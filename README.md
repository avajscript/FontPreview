Download the FontPreview.jar in the main project directory to run the project locally. It's a good way to preview all the fonts on your system. Keep in mind that it will create a folder data/favFonts.txt relative to where u store the .jar file.
So, if you store in in documents it will make documents/data/favFonts.txt. But it will not overwrite any folders, so if u have a folder named data, it won't be overwritten.
